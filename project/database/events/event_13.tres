text = "Sticking your hand into the demon's sharp teeth, you make a small offering to the fountain, a sharp pain rushes through your hand as your blood drops into the crimson pool, quickly lost like tears in the rain.

And just as the pain starts to fade away, you see the familiar glimmer of gold sparkling in the pool. With your other hand you reach to grab your reward: (highlight)<amount> gold coins(/highlight)!

You could leave now... or make another offering. The dark gods are known to (highlight)compensate highly(/highlight) those who push themselves to their limit for their amusement..."

The pain is only getting worse, but the fountain quickly returns the favor.

You reach for the pool of blood and retrieve (highlight)<amount> gold coins(/highlight).

Is it time to stop? Or continue pleasing the gods?"
leave_text_2 = "You stab your hand one last time, your hand already deformed from all those offerings.

But as you look to the pool in search of your reward, you are surprised to find something else, a gift from the gods themselves, pleased at your dedication.

You grab the object and resume your journey. As you walk away, you feel a dark presence looming over you. It gets a bit lighter after a few hours, but it never truly leaves..."

leave_text_4 = "You've made all the offerings you could.

You fix your hand with whatever you could find in your backpack, and leave this sinister place.

You feel a strange sensation taking over you as you leave, and it takes many hours until it goes back to normal..."
