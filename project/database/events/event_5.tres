text = "You come across a small hut, and the smell of fresh herbs invite you in.

An old-woman, with bushy eyebrows and vulpine eyes, welcomes you, and after peeking at the dangling reagents from your pouch, speaks with a raspy voice:

\"What some lovely trinkets you have there, care to make a deal? An offer I lay bare, one-for-one, what a steal!\"

She brings up a relative large bag, it's contents hidden from sight. You may grab bindly from it, but for each one a reagent you must leave behind."
leave_text_1 = "After leaving your part of the agreement upon a wooden table, you reach for the bag and collect you rewards.

\"You got what you received, and now you must leave, as my eyes have perceived, you must be in a hurry...
No time for sighs, no reason for goodbyes, come back anytime, have a safe journey!\"

The old-woman smiles delightfully while you step out the hut and resume your adventure."
