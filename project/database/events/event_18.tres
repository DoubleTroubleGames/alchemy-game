You've reached the infamous (highlight)Boneyard(/highlight).

You fail to find anything useful, only weirdly shaped bones and a few decaying Morhks left to their fate.

You then hear unappealing sounds, not far away... "

You then find a small but very promising chest, buried deep on a pile of bones! You dig up, open it, and inside you find a humble amount of (highlight)gold coins!(/highlight)

You then hear dreary sounds, not far away... "

After a while, you find something quite interesting! (highlight)A trinket(/highlight) hidden behind some Carapa remains. You clean it up and stash it among your belongings.

You then hear unattractive sounds, not far away... "
