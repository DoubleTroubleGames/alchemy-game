text = "You notice an (highlight)eerie cave(/highlight) in the distance, and as you approach, the shadow of a terrible creature moving through the walls asserts this is their lair. However, dark as it is, surely you'll be able to pass without a fight, but as you exame your surroundings you see a stolen (highlight)treasure chest(/highlight), exactly like the ones you've seen containing powerful artifacts from this forgotten kingdom.

\"Maybe I can get it without drawing attention, but is it worth the risk?\" you think to yourself as the prospect of treasure tempts you to get even closer..."

Your reward for this venture: a powerful artifact! And you'll be long gone before anyone finds out what you have done."
leave_text_2 = "You decide to try your luck, and start sneaking to your target. 
You reach the chest and find exactly what you are looking for, but before you can count yourself out of danger, a worrying sound of a creature running at your location tells you it's not over yet.

There is no other exit, so you'll have to fight your way out if you want to leave this place alive."

leave_text_4 = "You analyze the situation, and it's not worth risking an unnecessary fight over a stolen chest.

You continue your journey, glad you don't have to fight for your life another day."
