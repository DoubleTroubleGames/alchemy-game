text = "You notice an (highlight)enemy encampment(/highlight) in the distance, and as you approach the loud snoring from the creatures alleviates your worries. They're all sound asleep and surely you'll be able to pass without a fight, but as you get closer you see they have a stolen (bold)alchemist's chest(/bold), exactly like the ones you've seen containing artifacts from this forgotten kingdom.

\"Maybe I can get it without waking anyone, but is it worth the risk?\" you think to yourself as the prospect of treasure tempts you to get even closer..."

Your reward for this venture: a fine trinket. And you'll be long gone before anyone finds out what you have done."
leave_text_2 = "You decide to try your luck, and start sneaking to your target. 
You manage to reach it without any problems, but as you open the chest, a long and unwelcome creaking sound stops your heart, and before you know it, you hear a shout alarming your presence.

You'll have to fight your way out."

leave_text_4 = "You analyze the situation, and it's not worth risking an unnecessary fight over a stolen chest.

You continue your journey, glad you don't have to fight for your life another day."
