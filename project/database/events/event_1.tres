text = "While exploring, you pass by a misterious figure hidden beneath a dusty cloak.

(shake)\"Hey, wanna gamble?\"(/shake) you hear from the figure as a wide smile emerges from the shadowy hood.

His hand stretches to a small table in front of him, something you're sure wasn't there before. Two cards lay face down.

\"A game of chance huh\" you think to yourself. This might be an opportunity to make a few coins... (small)if you feel luck is by your side.(/small)"
leave_text_1 = "You pick a card and look at it.

Looking back at you is golden painting of a sun. A warm feeling of relief fills your mind.

A maniacal laugh turns your attention forward across the table, but you see only empty space where the cloaked figure used to be...

It is gone, but a shimmering pile of coins sits above the table.

(highlight)You gain <amount> gold.(/highlight)"
leave_text_2 = "You pick a card and look at it.

Looking back at you is a crimson painting of death. Shivers run down your spine.

A maniacal laugh turns your attention forward across the table, but you see only empty space where the cloaked figure used to be...

It is gone, along with your coins."
leave_text_3 = ""
leave_text_4 = "You don't trust luck is by your side, and you certainly don't feel confortable interacting with unknown creepy figures.

As you hesitate to accept the gambling offer, the hooded disappears in the blink of an eye. Maybe for the best.

You gather your belongings and resume your journey."
