text = "You come across a solitary well, a strange sight amidst all the chaos around you so far.

It seems in perfect condition despite the growing moss covering its surface.
You would feel ill at ease if not for an almost blissful aura radiating from it.

Maybe it's an invite to offer something.
Maybe it's just a trick of the light."
leave_text_1 = "The clattering sounds of your coins hitting the inner stone walls of the well fade into nothingness.
After a moment of silence, a faint splashing sound hits your eardrums.

You stare blankly for a few minutes, hoping something would magically happen.

Suddenly a golden glimmer catches you attention on the other side of well. You walk to it, to find an unnatended satchel full of gold!
\"Was this here before?\" the thought passes by your head while you hastily pick up every coin you can carry.

You walk away from the well, happier and a bit heavier than before.

(highlight)You gain <amount> gold.(/highlight)"
leave_text_2 = "The clatter sounds of your coins hitting the inner stone walls of the well fades into nothingness.
After a moment of silence, a faint splashing sound hits your eardrums.

You stare blankly for a few minutes, hoping something would magically happen.

In disbelief you start walking away when you immediatly stumble upon an artifact that was lying right behind your feet.
Amazed, you pickup the object, and continue onto your journey."
leave_text_3 = "The clattering sounds of your coins hitting the inner stone walls of the well fade into nothingness.
After a moment of silence, a faint splashing sound hits your eardrums.

You stare blankly for a few minutes, hoping something would magically happen.
It does not.
Grudgingly you walk away promising yourself to never be fooled by a well again..."
leave_text_4 = "Only a fool would throw coins to the indifferent void. You ignore the well and resume your journey, happy to leave that unsettling scenario behind."
